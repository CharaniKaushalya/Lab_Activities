# Lab Activities - Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains the lab activities completed using Cisco Packet Tracer. The labs cover various networking topics, configurations, and protocols relevant to networking and cybersecurity studies.

## Overview
In this repository, you will find various networking labs that I have completed using Cisco Packet Tracer. These activities aim to reinforce concepts learned in my networking courses and help in understanding how to configure and manage network devices like routers, switches, and access points.

## Lab Activities
Here are the activities included in this repository:
1. **Lab 1: Basic Router and Switch Configuration** - Introduction to basic configuration on routers and switches.
2. **Lab 2: IP Addressing and Subnetting** - Assigning IP addresses and creating subnets.
3. **Lab 3: VLAN Configuration** - Configuring Virtual LANs (VLANs) and trunking.
4. **Lab 4: Routing Protocols** - Configuring dynamic routing protocols such as RIP and OSPF.
5. **Lab 5: NAT and PAT Configuration** - Configuring Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT).
6. **Lab 6: ACL Configuration** - Access Control Lists (ACLs) for traffic filtering.
7. **Lab 7: Wireless Network Configuration** - Configuring wireless routers and access points.
